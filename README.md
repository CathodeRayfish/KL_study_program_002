# Simple_KL_study_program_001

This is a simple x86 real mode program that is designed for Kalaallisut study but (once I get a meaningful description of how to create question disks for it) it can really be used for any type of question-based study.

If you just want to use the program then download the latest from the releases section. Please see the included ProgramUserGuide.odt for instruction on how to get started using this program.

In the future I will also create instructions of how one can make their own disk files with custom questions.

(Note that just because there is no instructions yet does not mean it is not possible; all of the functionality is present in the code and there are some comments in the sourcedisk.asm file explaining a bit of how one would make their own questions so if you want to try without instructions it is certainly possible!


If you encounter any issues, bugs, or just have a suggestion please report them in Issues or send me a message on Discord!

Questions on base program disk are from chapter one of How to Learn Greenlandic by Stian Lybech: oqa.dk
